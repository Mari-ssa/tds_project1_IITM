Nominatim API with Python

You’ll learn how to get the latitude and longitude of any city from the Nominatim API.

Introduction to Nominatim: Understand how Nominatim, from OpenStreetMap, works similarly to Google Maps for geocoding.
Installation and Import: Learn to install and import geopy and nominatim.
Using the Locator: Create a locator object using Nominatim and set up a user agent.
Geocoding an Address: Use locator.geocode to input an address (e.g., Eiffel Tower) and fetch geocoded data.
Extracting Data: Access detailed information like latitude, longitude, bounding box, and accurate address from the JSON response.
Classifying Locations: Identify the type of place (e.g., tourism, university) using the response data.
Practical Example: Geocode “IIT Madras” and retrieve its full address, type (university), and other relevant information.

If you get a HTTP Error 403 from Nominatim, use your email ID or your name instead of “myGeocoder” in Nominatim(user_agent="myGeocoder")
