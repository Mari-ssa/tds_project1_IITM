You’ll learn how to use network analysis to identify clusters and connections between nodes in a dataset, covering:

Network Construction: Build a network from the IMDB database, where nodes represent actors and edges represent shared movie appearances.
Clustering: Apply clustering techniques to detect communities within the network, using scikit-learn’s network library.
Matrix Operations: Utilize matrix operations to efficiently analyze actor relationships and interactions.
Community Detection: Implement algorithms to identify and interpret clusters, examining how different actor clusters are connected.
Application of Findings: Explore practical applications of network analysis, such as social network analysis and its potential uses in various domains.
