CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements on a web page. They are fundamental to web development and data scraping, allowing you to precisely target elements for styling or extraction.

For data scientists, understanding CSS selectors is crucial when:

Web scraping with tools like Beautiful Soup or Scrapy
Selecting elements for browser automation with Selenium
Styling data visualizations and web applications
Debugging website issues using browser DevTools

Combinators: Use relationships between elements (div > p, div + p, div ~ p)
