Youâ€™ll learn how to perform geospatial analysis for location-based decision making, covering:

Distance Calculation: Compute distances between various store locations and a reference point, such as the Empire State Building.
Data Visualization: Visualize store locations on a map using Python libraries like Folium.
Store Density Analysis: Determine the number of stores within a specified radius.
Proximity Analysis: Identify the closest and farthest stores from a specific location.
Decision Making: Use geospatial data to assess whether opening a new store is feasible based on existing store distribution.
