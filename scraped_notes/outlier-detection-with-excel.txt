Outlier Detection with Excel

Youâ€™ll learn how to identify and handle outliers in data using Excel, covering:

Understanding Outliers: Definition of outliers and their impact on statistical analysis.
Calculating Quartiles: Using Excel formulas to calculate Q1 (first quartile) and Q3 (third quartile).
Interquartile Range (IQR): Finding the IQR by subtracting Q1 from Q3.
Determining Bounds: Calculating lower and upper bounds using 1.5 times the IQR.
Identifying Outliers: Using Excel functions to determine if data points fall outside the calculated bounds.
Visualizing Data: Creating box plots to visualize outliers and data distribution.
Handling Outliers: Deciding whether to exclude or keep outliers based on their impact on analysis.
