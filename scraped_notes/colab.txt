Notebooks: Google Colab

Google Colab is a free, cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that’s become indispensable for data scientists and ML practitioners. It’s particularly valuable because it provides free access to GPUs and TPUs, and for easy sharing of code and execution results.

While Colab is excellent for prototyping and learning, its free tier has limitations - notebooks time out after 12 hours, and GPU access can be inconsistent.

Learn how to mount Google Drive for persistent storage, manage dependencies with !pip install commands, as these are common pain points when getting started.
